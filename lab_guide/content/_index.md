In this workshop you will experience the challenges associated with the legendary AD Financial corporation as well as the perspectives of the different personas of their team as they work together to modernize and optimize their applications and operations to maximize innovation in a highly competitive market.

## Learning Objectives
* How to gain real-time visibility of your application topology including all components, dependencies, and activities as they are automatically discovered and mapped out.
* How you can measure the performance of key business transactions in your application both before and after your move to Kubernetes to validate the success of your modernization effort.
* How to make sure application performance is fully supported by your infrastructure with server, database, and network performance visibility when running containers outside of Kubernetes and within.
* How you can dramatically reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) detecting issues to avoid incidents for peak application and business performance using machine learning and artificial intelligence to automate anomaly detection and root cause analysis. 
* How you can visualize the entire user experience journey across your application and view performance to identify bottlenecks, prioritize issues, and determine the most frequent paths taken by end users.
