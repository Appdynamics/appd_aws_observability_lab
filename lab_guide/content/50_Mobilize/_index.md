Nathan is the Lead Architect for the modernization project at AD Financial.  Nathan was instrumental during the initial migration of the first set of  applications from the data center to AWS. Nathan understands the complexities and risks of moving and modernizing large production workloads and relies on the strategies, practices, and tools that have proven their value, leading to success.

When AD Financial first migrated its customer facing web application to AWS, Nathan had the AppDynamics advantage that assisted him and his team throughout the entire migration process.  Now that it's time to modernize the same application, Nathan and his team can quickly mobilize and gather the critcal data needed during this phase by utilizing AppDynamics.

There's **no need to keep manually creating and updating architecture diagrams** for your application when AppDynamics can provide you with a dynamic visual representation of the all the components, services, and depencies of your monitored application in direct context of the time frame you select.

The **AppDynamics Flow Map** goes far beyond a basic architecture diagram.  

It provides you **much more than just "an inventory list"**, such as:

 - The response time:
   -  for the whole application
   -  for each service
   -  between each service
   -  to each dependency
 - The calls per minute:
   - for the whole application
   - for each service
   - between each service
   - to each dependency
 - The errors per minute:
   - for the whole application
   - for each service
   - between each service
   - to each dependency

Let's follow Nathan and his team as they utilize AppDynamics to obtain the following aspects of the pre-modernized application in its current state:

- Identify application components, the hosts they run on, and the technologies in use
- Identify all dependencies across service APIs
- Identify all dependencies to backends and third-party systems
- Identify the key business transactions associated with services we want to refactor
- Identify the path those transactions take through the system with all components involved
- Identify where those key business transactions exist in the end user journey map
- Identify other business transactions that may be impacted by refactoring the key business transactions
